# java-for-retards 🧠💻

Welcome to the ultimate “learn Java the lazy way” repo! Here, I’ve thrown together some Java code examples and a tiny utility to make printing easier.  

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-for-retards.git
You might notice I sometimes use ln() instead of System.out.println(). Why? Because typing less is life.

How to use ln():

Grab the utils folder from this repo.

Keep it in the same folder as the Java files you’re working on.

// Example usage
ln("Hello, world!"); // Short and sweet

*important*
whenever you use ln() method in program you must type "import static utils.print.*" on the very first line of the file.
